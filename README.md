# Dynamic-pages-with-Gatsby-Node-MySQL-Contentful-RichText
Create dynamic pages with Gatsby and Contentful using "RichText" and GraphQL. 
The website was built with a headless CMS system (Contentful). 
Frontend was built in React (Gatsby) and Node.js was used for backend and was connected to a MySQL database. 
This resulted in that users of Contentful were able change content, create new components 
and have ability to create new pages dynamically using content management system Contentful.
